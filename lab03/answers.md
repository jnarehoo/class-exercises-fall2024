# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization
```
# paste code here
drwxr-xr-x   4 jasminenarehood  staff  128 Sep  5 10:14 .
drwxr-xr-x   8 jasminenarehood  staff  256 Sep  5 10:12 ..
drwxr-xr-x  10 jasminenarehood  staff  320 Sep  5 10:14 .git
-rw-r--r--   1 jasminenarehood  staff    9 Sep  5 10:13 README.md

```

### 1.2. Paste the output of your `git status` command
```
# paste code here
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   README.md



```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file
```
# paste code here
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output
```
# paste code here
commit 8a8e7e7a32d35e74601dd3bcfbf6cca4821ae8f9 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Jasmine Narehood <jasminenarehood@Jasmines-MacBook-Air.local>
Date:   Thu Sep 5 10:19:39 2024 -0400

    add README.md to the repository

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output
```
# paste code here
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

+Find All Duplicates: Write a function (or a static method in the case of Java)
+that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that
+appear more than once. 

```


### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init: Initializes a repository with the name of the current working directory and adds a .git file.
* git status: Tells you your branch, commits, and things that need to be commited.
* git add: Tells git that a particular file will be in the next commit.
* git commit: Commits files that you have added with git add.
* git log: Tells you the author, date, and what has been done.
* git diff: Tells you what has been changed. New lines are noted by a + at the front. 


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...
https://github.com/jnarehoo/lab03-exercises.git

```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.
"merge pull request" is creating a new commit that points to both previous branches.
"rebase and merge" is redefining when everything occured and allowing it to be a linear order of events. 
"squash and merge" combines the history of both branches when commiting
